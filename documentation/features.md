**Typetutor web app** 

Typetutor is an application that teaches you to type fast using fingers. 
It is designed to teach you the right technique and at the same time 
speed-up the learning curve. 

When you use Typetutor you can see how you progress, what are your weak points
and how to improve them. In the beginning the main goal is not to type fast,
but to teach your muscles the correct and most efficient patterns of motion.
Later on, when you have the technique in your muscle memory, your typing speed will increase.
